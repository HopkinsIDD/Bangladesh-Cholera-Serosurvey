	abstract = {Technological advances continue to develop for early detection of disease. Research studies are required to define the statistical properties of such screening or diagnostic tests. However, statistical methodology currently used to evaluate diagnostic tests is limited. We propose the use of marginal regression models with robust sandwich variance estimators to make inference about the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. This method is more flexible than standard methods in that it allows comparison of sensitivity between two or more tests even if all tests are not carried out on all subjects, it can accommodate correlated data, and the effect of covariates can be evaluated. This last feature is important since it allows researchers to understand the effects on sensitivity and specificity of various environmental and patient characteristics. If such factors are under the control of the clinician, it provides the opportunity to modify the diagnostic testing program to maximize sensitivity and/or specificity. We show that the marginal regression modelling methods generalize standard statistical methods. In particular, when we compare two screening tests and we test each subject with both screens, the method corresponds to McNemar's test. We describe data from an ongoing audiology screening study and we analyse a simulated version of the data to illustrate the methodology. We also analyse data from a longitudinal study of PCR as a diagnostic test for cytomegalovirus. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Over the last 20 years, comprehensive strategies for treating measurement error in complex models and accounting for the use of extra data to estimate measurement error parameters have emerged. Focusing on both established and novel approaches, Measurement Error: Models, Methods, and Applications provides an overview of the main techniques and illustrates their application in various models. It describes the impacts of measurement errors on naive analyses that ignore them and presents ways to correct for them across a variety of statistical models, from simple one-sample problems to regression models to more complex mixed and time series models.  The book covers correction methods based on known measurement error parameters, replication, internal or external validation data, and, for some models, instrumental variables. It emphasizes the use of several relatively simple methods, moment corrections, regression calibration, simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), modified estimating equation methods, and likelihood techniques. The author uses SAS-IML and Stata to implement many of the techniques in the examples.  Accessible to a broad audience, this book explains how to model measurement error, the effects of ignoring it, and how to correct for it. More applied than most books on measurement error, it describes basic models and methods, their uses in a range of application areas, and the associated terminology.},

	abstract = {Estimating the true prevalence of cholera
Successful development of anti-cholera measures requires accurate estimates of infection incidence. Reporting of cholera cases, however, typically relies on clinical assessment at the time of patient presentation and can be problematized by lack of access to health care and variable, nonspecific symptomatology. Combining a small number of serological markers with machine learning methods, Azman et al. were able to accurately detect individuals who had had cholera infections within the previous year. Simulated serosurveys showed that this simple antibody-based approach could potentially be used as an alternative method to estimate cholera incidence in a population.
The development of new approaches to cholera control relies on an accurate understanding of cholera epidemiology. However, most information on cholera incidence lacks laboratory confirmation and instead relies on surveillance systems reporting medically attended acute watery diarrhea. If recent infections could be identified using serological markers, cross-sectional serosurveys would offer an alternative approach to measuring incidence. Here, we used 1569 serologic samples from a cohort of cholera cases and their uninfected contacts in Bangladesh to train machine learning models to identify recent Vibrio cholerae O1 infections. We found that an individual’s antibody profile contains information on the timing of V. cholerae O1 infections in the previous year. Our models using six serological markers accurately identified individuals in the Bangladesh cohort infected within the last year [cross-validated area under the curve (AUC), 93.4\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 92.1 to 94.7\%], with a marginal performance decrease using models based on two markers (cross-validated AUC, 91.0\%; 95\% CI, 89.2 to 92.7\%). We validated the performance of the two-marker model on data from a cohort of North American volunteers challenged with V. cholerae O1 (AUC range, 88.4 to 98.4\%). In simulated serosurveys, our models accurately estimated annual incidence in both endemic and epidemic settings, even with sample sizes as small as 500 and annual incidence as low as two infections per 1000 individuals. Cross-sectional serosurveys may be a viable approach to estimating cholera incidence.

Distinct patterns in seasonality were found for rotavirus diarrhoea which peaked in winter across the sites (December and January) and dipped during the rainy season (May) in urban Dhaka, August in Mirpur and July in Matlab, equated by time-series analysis using quasi-Poisson regression model. Significant seasonality for shigellosis was observed in Dhaka and rural Mirzapur. Cholera had robust seasonality in Dhaka and Matlab in the hot and rainy seasons. For enterotoxogenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhoea, clearly defined seasonality was observed in Dhaka (summer).

	abstract = {Summary. Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

We develop a Bayesian framework for cluster sampling and account for the design effect in the outcome modeling. We consider a two-stage cluster sampling design where the clusters are first selected with probability proportional to cluster size, and then units are randomly sampled inside selected clusters. Challenges arise when the sizes of the nonsampled cluster are unknown. We propose nonparametric and parametric Bayesian approaches for predicting the unknown cluster sizes, with this inference performed simultaneously with the model for survey outcome, with computation performed in the open-source Bayesian inference engine Stan. Simulation studies show that the integrated Bayesian approach outperforms classical methods with efficiency gains, especially under informative cluster sampling design with small number of selected clusters. We apply the method to the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study as an illustration of inference for complex health surveys.},
